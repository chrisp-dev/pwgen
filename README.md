## Password Generator Purpose and Functionality

> The password generator operates by clicking on the `generate password` button. Follow the prompts and their given questions to produce a randomized password printed right on the page. Once the password is generated, as a bonus, you'll find the 'Copy Password' button to copy it right to your clipboard! :fire::fire::fire:
